## Features:
- Fixed broken sprites which caused crashes.
- More spies and only you can kill them!
- Modified scoring algorithm.
- Added spy count and bonus for killing all spies.
- Removed offensive variable names related to the CIA.

### Note: SpyHunt.HC is just for github, has no sprites and is not playable!  Use SpyHunt.ISO.C

## To Play:
 - Mount in SpyHunt.ISO.C a virtual cd drive or copy it to your hard drive and run MountFile("/path/to/SpyHunt.ISO.C");
 - Change to the appropriately mounted drive or file and #include "SpyHunt";
 - SpyHunt;

## Hint:
 - Spys initially start out clustered with the blue "good" guys.  Unfortunately for them, their cover got blown so they blink blue/purple.  Realizing they lost their cover they migrate to the bad guys and eventually stand so close to them that they are hard to find.
